# FeatureEngineering
Projects from the UNT course Feature Engineering 2023 CSCE 5222



Introduction:
The rapid progress in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Machine Learning (ML), has significantly impacted various facets of society. ML models play a crucial role in technologies used in daily life, but their complexity demands deep statistical understanding, specialized hardware, and access to high-quality big data. Feature engineering, a vital part of ML model development, involves transforming raw data into informative features to enhance model performance. Despite its importance, feature engineering often involves manual tweaking and lacks a systematic approach. In this project, the authors propose treating feature engineering as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, allowing an RL agent to automatically discover effective feature transformations based on previous experiences. The goal is to leverage RL advancements to systematize feature engineering and make this advanced technology accessible to non-experts.

Goals and Objectives:
The project aims to develop an end-to-end RL framework tailored for feature engineering, striving for state-of-the-art performance across diverse problem domains. The overarching objective is to democratize this advanced technology and provide insights into effective strategies for different data types. The project includes designing a flexible RL formulation for feature engineering, conducting comprehensive benchmarking against human experts, and focusing on methods for interpreting learned policies to enhance transparency. Evaluation of model fairness and the release of code, models, and tutorials aim to ensure widespread adoption and continuous improvement of the technology.
